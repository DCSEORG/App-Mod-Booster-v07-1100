Create deployment scripts: deploy.sh (basic) and deploy-with-chat.sh (with GenAI).

Deployment Order (with 30-second waits for resource readiness):
1. Deploy resource group, App Service, and SQL Database
2. Configure App Service settings
3. Wait 30 seconds for SQL Server to be ready
4. Add IP to SQL firewall (current IP + Azure services)
5. Install Python dependencies (pip3 install --quiet pyodbc azure-identity)
6. Import database schema (python3 run-sql.py)
7. Configure database roles (python3 run-sql-dbrole.py)
8. Create stored procedures (python3 run-sql-stored-procs.py)
9. Build and zip application code
10. Deploy app.zip to App Service

SQL Firewall Configuration:
```bash
MY_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)
SQL_SERVER_NAME=$(echo $SQL_SERVER_FQDN | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Allow Azure services (0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0)
az sql server firewall-rule create --name "AllowAllAzureIPs" ...

# Add deployment IP
az sql server firewall-rule create --name "AllowDeploymentIP" --start-ip-address $MY_IP ...
```

App.zip Requirements:
- Exclude from .gitignore (include in repo)
- Files must be at ZIP root (not in subdirectory)
- Must unzip to app folder with DLL inside

deploy-with-chat.sh:
- Deploys GenAI resources first
- Retrieves endpoints via: az deployment group show --query "properties.outputs.openAIEndpoint.value"
- Sets App Service environment variables:
  * OpenAI__Endpoint
  * OpenAI__DeploymentName
  * AZURE_CLIENT_ID (managed identity client ID)
  * ManagedIdentityClientId

Both scripts must be executable with single command: bash deploy.sh or bash deploy-with-chat.sh

User notification: App URL is <app-url>/Index (not root)
