Create Bicep code for Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search (AI Search) resources.

Configuration:
- SKU: S0 (low cost for development)
- Model: GPT-4o in swedencentral region (even if resource group is UKSOUTH - avoid quota issues)
- Capacity: 8 (Standard SKU)
- Use lower case names (customSubDomainName must be lowercase)

Role Assignments:
- Assign "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" role to the managed identity from prompt-001
- Use managedIdentityPrincipalId (passed as parameter from main.bicep)
- DO NOT create new managed identity in this module

Outputs Required:
- openAIEndpoint
- openAIModelName
- openAIName
- searchEndpoint (if AI Search is created)

GenAISettings:
- Store all configuration in a GenAISettings file for reference

Important Notes:
- Use managedIdentity.properties.principalId for role assignments (it's a GUID)
- This module receives principalId from app-service.bicep via main.bicep
- The App Service's managed identity is used for all GenAI authentication
- Settings cannot be configured in Bicep due to circular dependency - deployment script handles this

This is OPTIONAL infrastructure - deploy.sh works without it, deploy-with-chat.sh includes it.
