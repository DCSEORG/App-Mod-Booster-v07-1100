Create REST APIs for all functionality shown in Legacy-Screenshots.

Requirements:
1. Create API endpoints for all database operations
2. APIs must use stored procedures (no direct SQL)
3. Include Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
4. Both the main app and chat UI must use these APIs (no direct database access)

API Design:
- RESTful conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON request/response bodies
- Input validation
- Error handling with meaningful messages

Swagger Configuration:
- Enable Swagger UI at /swagger
- Document all endpoints with descriptions, parameters, and response types
- Include example requests/responses
- Allow testing APIs directly from Swagger UI

The APIs serve as the single source of truth for all database interactions.
