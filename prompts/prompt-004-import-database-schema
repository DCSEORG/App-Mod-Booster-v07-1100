Create Python script run-sql.py to import database schema using Azure AD authentication.

Configuration:
- SERVER: Use SQL server FQDN from Bicep outputs
- DATABASE: "Northwind"
- SQL_SCRIPT_FILE: "Database-Schema/Northwinds Schema.sql"

Script must:
1. Use AzureCliCredential for authentication
2. Connect via ODBC with token authentication (SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN = 1256)
3. Parse SQL file by GO statements
4. Execute each statement individually with error handling
5. Log progress with ✓ and ✗ symbols

Cross-platform considerations:
- Use sed with .bak extension for Mac compatibility: 
  sed -i.bak "s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/g" file && rm -f file.bak

Dependencies (to be installed in deployment script):
- pyodbc
- azure-identity

The script will be called from the deployment script after SQL firewall rules are configured.
