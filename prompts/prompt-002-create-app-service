Create Bicep code to deploy an App Service to UKSOUTH region.

Configuration:
- SKU: Standard S1 (to avoid cold start issues)
- Assign the user-assigned managed identity created in prompt-001
- Use lower case names for all Azure resources (never upper case)
- Use uniqueString(resourceGroup().id) for unique resource naming

Output from this module:
- appServiceName
- appServiceUrl
- managedIdentityPrincipalId (from the assigned identity)
- managedIdentityClientId (for environment variable AZURE_CLIENT_ID)

Note: Do NOT configure OpenAI__Endpoint or OpenAI__DeploymentName in Bicep app settings - this creates circular dependency. These will be set post-deployment via deployment script.
