Create a user assigned managed identity with naming pattern: mid-AppModAssist-[uniqueString]

Use uniqueString(resourceGroup().id) for uniqueness, not timestamps or utcNow().

Important: When using a user-assigned managed identity, the principalId property is not directly on the identity object. Access it via identity.properties.principalId.

Output the following from the managed identity module:
- managedIdentityId (resource ID)
- managedIdentityClientId (for AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable)
- managedIdentityPrincipalId (for role assignments)

This managed identity will be used by:
1. App Service to connect to Azure SQL
2. App Service to connect to Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search
3. GenAI resources for cross-service authentication
