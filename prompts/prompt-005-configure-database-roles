Create script.sql and run-sql-dbrole.py to configure database roles for the managed identity.

script.sql contents:
```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = 'MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME')
BEGIN
    DROP USER [MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME];
END

CREATE USER [MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME];
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME];
GRANT EXECUTE TO [MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME];
```

run-sql-dbrole.py:
- Same structure as run-sql.py
- SERVER and DATABASE from Bicep outputs
- SQL_SCRIPT_FILE: "script.sql"
- Use sed to replace MANAGED-IDENTITY-NAME placeholder (cross-platform safe)

This grants the managed identity full read/write/execute permissions on the database.
