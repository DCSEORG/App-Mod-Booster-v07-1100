Create stored-procedures.sql (if database schema doesn't already have stored procedures).

Requirements:
1. Analyze Database-Schema/Northwinds Schema.sql to identify all tables
2. Create stored procedures for all CRUD operations
3. Use "CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE" syntax
4. Name procedures clearly (e.g., GetProducts, CreateOrder, UpdateCustomer)

Create run-sql-stored-procs.py:
- Same structure as run-sql.py and run-sql-dbrole.py
- SQL_SCRIPT_FILE: "stored-procedures.sql"

Application code MUST:
- Use ONLY stored procedures (no direct table access, no T-SQL in app code)
- Not call any stored procedure names that don't exist in stored-procedures.sql

This enforces separation of concerns and prevents SQL injection.
