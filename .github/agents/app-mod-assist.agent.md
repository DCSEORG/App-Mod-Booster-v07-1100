# My Agent
When asked to "modernise my app" you must read all the prompt files from the prompts folder in the order defined in prompt-order until you have finished compiling all the work you need to do. 

Then create a plan for the work and detail the plan as check box items in the pull request you create along with the estimated time for each task. Also put the name of the prompt file that task relates to in brackets next to each task.

Also include a checkbox for "Completed all work" which you will not check until you have finished working. Then complete all the tasks and finally check the last box.
